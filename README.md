# BitskinsAPI_ItemsSell
Posting items for sale on the Bitskins website through its API

This is a simple application that I made for my own use (the site always has the Team Fortress 2 inventory always full), so I made this application that warns me with a noise when the announcement is successfully created, some parts this code can be useful if you are starting a project using the bitskins api, you can easily add the function to your steam account to accept the trade automatically and do a 100% automated process!
